Build production-ready REST APIs faster. RESTworld layers curated, battle-tested frameworks on top of ASP.NET Core so you can ship HAL-driven, discoverable endpoints without reinventing the basics.

## Why teams choose RESTworld

- **Accelerate delivery:** scaffold CRUD and read pipelines in minutes, then tailor behavior with focused extension points.
- **Delight consumers:** HAL and HAL-FORMS links, OData query support, and consistent pagination create self-describing APIs.
- **Stay future-proof:** version DTOs safely, plug in resource-based authorization, and trace everything with OpenTelemetry.
- **Run anywhere:** health endpoints and Aspire integration make it simple to deploy to Kubernetes, containers, or your laptop.
