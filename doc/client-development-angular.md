# Angular Client Development

RESTworld embraces HAL and OData so Angular SPAs can discover capabilities dynamically. Pick the guide that best matches what you are working on:

- [Angular Client Core Concepts](client-development-angular-core.md) – understand HAL discovery, OData queries, batching, and version negotiation from the client perspective.
- [Angular Client Setup](client-development-angular-setup.md) – follow the ExampleBlog blueprint to configure providers, routing, layout, and multiple API targets.
- [Angular Client Components](client-development-angular-components.md) – reuse `<rw-table>`, `<rw-form>`, and PrimeNG styling patterns inside custom pages.

Each guide builds on the sample app located at `src/Example/ExampleBlog/ExampleBlog.Client.Angular`. Mix and match the topics to fit your application, and revisit [Configuration](configuration.md) when you need to point your SPA at additional RESTworld APIs.
